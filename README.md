# Smart-Garage
The Smart Garage system uses IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor to detect car presence and parking space status. It automatically opens the gate using a servo motor when a car approaches or exits. An LCD displays real-time parking availability, making it an efficient and automated parking management solution.
